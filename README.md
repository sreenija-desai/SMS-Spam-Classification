# SMS-Spam-Classification
SMS spam classification is the process of automatically identifying whether a given text message is spam (unsolicited and often promotional) or legitimate (non-spam or ham). This task is essential for filtering out unwanted messages and protecting users from potential scams, fraud, and other malicious activities.

# Data Collection: 
 Gather a dataset of text messages labeled as spam or ham. This dataset should ideally be diverse and representative of the types of messages encountered in real-world scenarios.
# Data Preprocessing: 
Clean the text data by removing noise, such as special characters, punctuation, and stopwords (commonly occurring words like "and," "the," etc.). Additionally, perform text normalization techniques like lowercasing and stemming/lemmatization to reduce the dimensionality of the data

# DATASET :
